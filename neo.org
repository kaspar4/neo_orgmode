#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+DESCRIPTION: An org-babel based emacs configuration I find useful

This is only for playing with github and copybara. And some more of that. And then some.

And more of the same.


* Introduction
This is my personal Emacs configuration. This is not the first time
I declare [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy][Emacs bankrupcy]] and start over with a new emacs life.

It is not intended to be general or beginner-friendly. If you're a
beginner you'll probably be better off with one of the many emacs
configurations with batteries included.

Also, my Emacs stays on for weeks or months at a time; I'm not
interested in reducing startup time or delaying loading of packages
until they're first used. It simply doesn't affect me.

* Modules
I keep my configuration in separate org-mode files. It would be
posible to work with a single file (and this is what I actually did
before I wrote code to tangle files containing include directives). I
find that a single file is more prone to increase the entropy of the
universe.

~neo-init.org~ is a bit special, it is ~#+INCLUDEd~ here so that it is
exported to HTML when I publish this Emacs configuration, but is not
really included.  I mean, it is, but since it doesn't contain any
elisp blocks, it is a no-op
