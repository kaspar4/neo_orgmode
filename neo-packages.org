* Package Configurations

We use ~straight.el~ for package installation, but ~use-package~ for
configuration. Here we setup a few useful extensions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (message "package-archives %s" (if (boundp 'package-archives) "BOUND" "UNBOUND"))
  (use-package package
    :custom
    (package-user-dir (neo/litter-directory "melpa" emacs-version))
    :config
    (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t))
#+end_src

The modeline becomes unwieldy when lot of minor modes try to say
things there.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package delight)
#+end_src

In theory, ~use-package-chord~ is deprecated and the functionality built-in
into ~use-package~. In practice, without it I cannot get the ~:chords~
keyword to work.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package use-package-chords
    :config (key-chord-mode 1))
#+end_src

My understanding is that ensure-system-package has been folded into
the ~use-package~ package. It doesn't seem the case in my version.
  - verify this

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package system-packages
    :config
    (setq system-packages-package-manager 'apt)
    (setq system-packages-use-sudo t)
    )
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package use-package-ensure-system-package)
#+END_SRC
